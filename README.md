## Prerequisites
- [Python 3.9.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/) 

## Installation

[Comprehensive Installation Guide](https://github.com/KoljaB/Linguflex/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or for a minimal configuration ("Vanilla"): `pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt`

Enter OpenAI API key either:
- into the file `config.txt` in the section [openai_generator] into the key "api_key"
- or into the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY

Note: For faster speech recognition with GPU support, the [NVIDIA¬Æ CUDA¬Æ Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) should be installed before the (pytorch-)installation.

## Start
```
python linguflex
```

## Configuration
The `config.txt` includes:
- System settings such as the languages used
- the modules to be loaded in the [modules] section (modules are loaded and started in the order specified here)
- the configuration parameters of the modules

---

# Basic Modules

```
user_interface
openai_generator
microphone_recorder
whisper_speechtotext
system_texttospeech
```

Enable basic voice communication with the assistant. 

## Microphone Calibration
First, the microphone should be set in the section [microphone_recorder] of the configuration file config.txt. Recording begins when the level exceeds the value in `volume_start_recording` and stops when the level falls below the value in `volume_stop_recording`. To determine these values, set debug_show_volume = True and start Linguflex, the exact level values are then written to the console window.

# Text-to-Speech Modules

These modules provide enhanced speech output and replace the existing `system_texttospeech` module in the `[modules]` section of the configuration file.

The modules for Azure and Elevenlabs can be operated in parallel and need API keys, which are stored in the respective section in the configuration file or defined as an environment variable. Localized voices are managed for these two modules in their respective voice configuration file.

  - `edge_texttospeech` uses the Edge browser window for speech output, provides free, high-quality speech synthesis, but with slightly reduced stability and comfort due to the use of the browser window.
  - `azure_texttospeech` provides high-quality, stable and comfortable speech synthesis; requires a [Microsoft Azure API Key](https://portal.azure.com/); enter api key in section azure_texttospeech into the key api_key or in the registry environment variable AZURE_SPEECH_KEY; voice configuration file: azure_texttospeech.voices.de/en.json
  - `elevenlabs_texttospeech` also offers high-quality, stable and comfortable speech synthesis with emotional output; requires an [Elevenlabs API Key](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/Elevenlabs); enter api key in section elevenlabs_texttospeech into the key api_key or in the registry environment variable ELEVENLABS_SPEECH; voice configuration file: elevenlabs_texttospeech.voices.de/en.json
