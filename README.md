## Introduction

Linguflex 2.0 emerges from a deep-rooted passion for science fiction, aspiring to create voice-based, dynamic, and convincingly human-like interactions with AI. Linguflex is a solid voice based function calling framework supporting a variety of LLMs (local included). It combines relentless pursuit of minimal latency (ensuring rapid responses) with a outstanding TTS voice quality, all locally generated. This new version marks a significant stride towards realizing a versatile, yet specialized AI assistant.

## Key Advancements in 2.0
